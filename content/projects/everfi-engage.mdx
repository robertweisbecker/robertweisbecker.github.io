## About

Engage allows financial institutions to deliver in-person financial education to their customers and the community via guided workshop events at their branches. The product consists of 13 digital learning modules covering personal finance & money management, small business operations, and home ownership.

## Audience

Engage workshops are geared toward low- to moderate-income adults, families, and small business owners. In order to help these users feel at ease with weighty topics, the visual design relied on soft colors and springy animation, and content was written in a casual and approachable tone.

## Component Library

Upon joining the project, I had the team migrate existing designs from Adobe XD to Sketch, so that we could use it to build a reusable component library that would let us rapidly execute and iterate. That change in process led to the creation of a template library containing 40+ unique pages in mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.

## Interactions

To prototype new interactions, I learned to use Flinto, Framer, and Invision Studio, and freshened up on HTML/CSS to ship code directly to developers.

A sampling of these are below:
