## Context

Forge is the primary tool used by Everfi's implementation team, who translate course designs into interactive e-learning products. It's a Git-connected Electron app that provides an interface for a local development environment. Forge leverages the Everfi SDK and component library (aka [Furnace](/furnace)) to allow for course creation and ongoing maintenance.

For much of its existence, Forge was largely a JSON content editing tool with a minimal interface. However, the launch of Furnace in early 2020 hastened adoption by the product team, and requests for more powerful WYSIWYG-like features quickly outpaced design capacity.

The pace of iteration left the app without polish and well-considered UX, and its rough edges began to show.

## Areas of Focus

### Color & Contrast

In lieu of shadows, increasing lightness can visually communicate a surface as having been elevated. This is especially important in Forge, given the hierarchical parent-child nature of its editor views.

Just one problem — Forge's styles included only five neutrals whose lightness topped out too quickly, making text virtually illegible after a few child views.

Additional variables that fell outside the color scale were also added to the SCSS, leading to inconsistencies like `$interactive-925`.

<LayoutGrid variant="twoUp">
	<ImageModal
		src="/assets/forge/colors-neutral.png"
		caption="Neutrals before and after"
	/>
	<ImageModal
		src="/assets/forge/colors-teal.png"
		caption="Primary colors before and after"
	/>
</LayoutGrid>

The new color scale includes values ranging from 100 to 900, plus white and black. Each value falls within a similar lightness range as its siblings, so we can apply colors from different palettes in a more predictable and accessible manner.

<ImageModal
	src="/assets/forge/colors-all.png"
	caption="Full color palette updates"
/>

Applied to typography and surfaces, the new color palettes fully resolved any contrast concerns:

<LayoutGrid variant="twoUp">
	<ImageModal src="/assets/forge/contrast1.png" caption="Darker darks!" />
	<ImageModal src="/assets/forge/contrast2.png" caption="Lighter lights!" />
</LayoutGrid>

The expanded color system also allowed more nuanced styling: consistent states, additional variants, and a more distinct difference between color modes.

<ImageToggle
	before="/assets/forge/dark.png"
	after="/assets/forge/light.png"
	tab1="Dark Mode"
	tab2="Light Mode"
/>

### Density

	caption="Dense spacing and type applied to input fields"
/>

<ImageModal
	src="/assets/forge/density-compare.png"
	caption="60% shorter (difference in red)"
/>

### Navigation

A crucial aspect of Forge's utility derives from having its edit views auto-generated by page and component schema.
But organization that makes sense in code doesn't always make sense in a UI.

Edit forms unrelated to content now overtakes the preview. There, you're editing the course itself — not the page you're looking at — free real estate that reinforces the idea of editing a higher-level view.

<ImageToggle
	before="/assets/forge/edit-activity-before.png"
	after="/assets/forge/edit-activity-after.png"
/>

This also benefitted performance and usability, since the old edit UI always opened another panel adjacent to the navigation, causing the live preview to resize and force a refresh, losing context.

<ImageToggle
	before="/assets/forge/edit-page-before.png"
	after="/assets/forge/edit-page-after.png"
/>

Page actions move a hidden context menu on list items to a dedicated dropdown on the parent view. No longer split between nav levels, all editing moves to the same pane.

<ImageModal
	src="/assets/forge/sidebar.png"
	caption="Before & after of menu hierarchy and actions"
/>

### Standardization

A look at some components with standardized styling:

<ImageModal src="/assets/forge/buttons.png" caption="Buttons" />

<ImageModal src="/assets/forge/fields.png" caption="Redesigned inputs" />

<ImageModal src="/assets/forge/nav.png" caption="Toolbar" />

<ImageModal src="/assets/forge/dialogs.png" caption="Dialogs" />

### Custom widgets

<LayoutGrid variant="twoUp">
	<ImageModal src="/assets/forge/widgets.png" caption="Utility class widgets" />
	<ImageModal src="/assets/forge/theme-picker.png" caption="Theme picker" />
</LayoutGrid>

<ImageModal
	src="/assets/forge/locale.png"
	caption="In-context locale string editing"
/>

<ImageModal
	src="/assets/forge/template-logic.png"
	caption="Template builder prototypes"
/>

And, for good measure, I also created icons for the production and development versions of the app:
