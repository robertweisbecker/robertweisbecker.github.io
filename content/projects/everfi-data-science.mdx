## Data Science Foundations

EVERFI's K12 Data Science courses are intended to provide upper high school students with the skills and knowledge they need to accurately evaluate the ROI of a data science education and career options.

The 101 course, Foundations, introduces students to the concept of data science why it matters — covering the collection, visualization, and interpretation of data.

Each instruction module culminates in an interactive lab where learners act as a data scientist assisting a business. They practice collecting, cleaning, and verifying data; evaluate the difference between descriptive and predictive analytics; and decide how to employ data to influence customers.

### Lab 1: What is Data Science?

Help Malachi boost his clothing company's sales.

#### Analyzing and Visualizing Data

Students will learn about the processes of analyzing and visualizing data and will explore various ways that data can be presented. Use various displays and analytics tools to understand data sets.

Assist Arun in performing statistical analysis on his data to optimize the performance of a soccer team.

#### Reporting and Acting on Data

Students will understand the different uses of dashboards and reports, then determine which is better to use for a variety of audiences. Summarizing data for different audiences in order to inform business decisions.

Use probability and statistics to help PlanetPlan choose their next conservation project.

## Banking Industry

The Data Science Exploration: Banking Fraud is a 201 course dedicated to providing upper high school students with the skills and knowledge they need to accurately evaluate the ROI of data science education and career options specifically within the banking industry.

It will refresh learners on some core concepts from the Data Science Foundations course and introduce them to the role data science plays in the banking industry, including:

Students will discover how fraud in financial transactions is detected and mitigated. Students will determine when risk of fraud is highest and how steps are taken to prevent fraud.

#### Automation

Students will learn about the use of machine learning to automate processes such as data collection, analysis, fraud detection and prevention.

Students will discover how fraud in financial transactions is detected and mitigated. Students will determine when risk of fraud is highest and how steps are taken to prevent fraud.

### Banking Fraud Simulation

#### Learning Objectives:

Students will be able to...

- List examples of how data science is used to prevent risk in the financial industry.
- List examples of how data science is used to create improved processes and automation in the financial industry.
